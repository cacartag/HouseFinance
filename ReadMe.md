# Data extractor and parser for real estate data

## The following is what I have so far
- Trulia site extractor of initial page

## Working On
- Trulia page navigator to travel to each page available
- My flow will do the following:
  - [X] Retrieve page 
  - [X] Parse pagination
  - [X] Use pagination to traverse to each individual result
  - [X] Traverse each result and parse 
  - [ ] Store data in file 
  - [ ] Add timer to have data be scraped once every 6 hours
